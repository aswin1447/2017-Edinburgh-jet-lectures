# Jet Physics at the LHC

Material connected with the "Jet Physics at the LHC" lectures at the Edinburgh
[Higgs Centre School of Theoretical Physics 2017](https://higgs.ph.ed.ac.uk/workshops/higgs-centre-school-theoretical-physics-2017).

To get the full benefit from the tutorial sessions, __please bring a
laptop.__ Some of the tutorials will need a linux /
mac-like system and a C++ compiler. (If you're under Windows, you can
install a linux system as a virtual machine, e.g. with VirtualBox).
